# Dear Woman,

Sometimes,<br />
You'll just be too much woman.<br />
Too smart,<br />
Too beautiful,<br />
Too strong,<br />
Too much of something<br />
That makes a man feel like less of a man,<br />
Which will start making you feel like you have to be less of a woman.<br />

The bigger mistake you can make<br />
Is removing jewels from your crown<br />
To make it easier for a man to carry.<br />

When this happens, I need you to understand,<br />
You do not need a smaller crown--<br />
You need  man with bigger hands.
